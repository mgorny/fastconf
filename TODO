fastconf TODO
=============

General TODO
------------

1. Describe undescribed functions, add a C example to `GUIDE`,
2. Support guessing the `--build` system (so that we could be able
	to at least guess whether we're cross-compiling if only `--host`
	is passed),
3. Support specifying a general builddir.


`cc` module TODO
----------------

1. Support mixing sources and compiled objects in `fc_cc_build()`.


`install` module TODO
---------------------

1. Support installing manpages.


QA TODO
-------

1. Introduce checking for whitespace whenever it is undesired
	(e.g. in `fc_array_append()`),
2. Review the code for uncatched but allowed failures (to enable
	fastconf to run successfully with `set -e`).


Additional modules
------------------

1. `cxx` -- C++ counterparts of `cc` module functions,
2. `simple-checks` -- autoconf-like, universal, simple checks
	for interface existence being able to use either `cc` or `cxx`
	as the compiler backend.
